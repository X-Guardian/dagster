# Get started with Dagster+

First [create a Dagster+ organization](https://dagster.plus/signup). Note: you can sign up with:
- a Google email address
- a GitHub account
- a one-time email link, great if you are using a corporate email. You can setup SSO after completing these steps.

Next, pick your deployment type. Not sure?

- [Dagster+ Serverless](/dagster-plus/deployment/serverless) is the easiest way to get started and is great for teams with limited DevOps support. In Dagster+ Serverless, your Dagster code is executed in Dagster+. You will need to be okay [giving Dagster+ the credentials](/dagster-plus/deployment/environment-variables) to connect to the tools you want to orchestrate.

- [Dagster+ Hybrid](/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid) is great for teams who want to orchestrate tools without giving Dagster+ direct access to your systems. Dagster+ Hybrid requires more DevOps support.

The remaining steps depend on your deployment type.

The Dagster+ on-boarding will guide you through:
- creating a Git repository containing your Dagster code
- setting up the necessary CI/CD actions to deploy that repository to Dagster+

:::tip
If you don't have any Dagster code yet, you will have the option to select an example quickstart project or import an existing dbt project

See the guide on [adding code locations](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations) for details.

## Install a Dagster+ Hybrid agent

Follow [these guides](/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid) for installing a Dagster+ Hybrid agent. Not sure which agent to pick? We recommend using the Dagster+ Kubernetes agent in most cases.


## Setup CI/CD

In most cases, your CI/CD process will be responsible for:
- building your Dagster code into a Docker image
- pushing your Docker image to a container registry you manage
- notifying Dagster+ of the new or updated code

Refer to the guide for [adding a code location](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations) for more detail.
